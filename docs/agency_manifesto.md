## NL2SQLAgency Manifesto

### Mission
Develop an AI-powered SQL agent that translates natural language queries into SQL, executes them on a PostgreSQL database, and generates insights dynamically.

### Goals
- Provide an automated solution for converting natural language queries into SQL queries.
- Ensure accurate and efficient query translation and execution.
- Facilitate seamless interaction between users and databases through natural language.

### Working Environment
- The agency will operate in an environment that requires PostgreSQL database connection and OpenAI API key for GPT-4.
- Agents will collaborate to parse, convert, execute, and analyze SQL queries based on user input.

### Dependencies
- **PostgreSQL Database Connection**: Required for executing SQL queries.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for using the GPT-4 model to summarize SQL query results.
